     Honestly, within prototype 2, I can't really implement the leftButtonPressed and rightButtonPressed functions.
     I saved these for prototype 2; however, do due COVID-19 i can't implement these since I not only don't have the vehicle to test them on, but I also don't know how our mech-e plans on getting the vehicle to physically turn since this was also not discussed for prototype 1.
     Hopefully the person grading this will understand the reason I can't implement these functions.
